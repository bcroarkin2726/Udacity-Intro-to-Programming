<em>HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b></em><br>
<br>

HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b><br>
<br>

HTML consists of tags and elements that are broken up in the following format:<br>
&lttag>Contents&lttag><br>
The <b>tags</b> tell the browsers the type of the element to be used.<br>
<br>

You can use HTML to post <em>images</em>:<br>
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="Mountain View">
<br>
<em>Links</em>:<br>
This website is <a href="https://udacity.com">my favorite</a><br>
<br>
<b>AND MUCH MORE!</b><br>

<br>
There is so much to know in HTML though, so if you ever need help<br>
there are many resources online to help.
<br><br>
<a href="https://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> is a great resource for when you need additional help<br>
<br>

For instance, I got these great definitions below for inline and block-level elements there!
<br>
<h4>Block-level Elements</h4>
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available <br>
(stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
<h4>Inline Elements</h4>
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

<!--Comments are also important tools in HTML because you need to make this code
readable for other humans -->
