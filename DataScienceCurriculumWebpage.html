        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> <a name="About Me"> </a>
          I am seeking to transition my career towards data science. I graduated from the University of Virginia
          in 2015 with a degree in Economics. Currently, I am working out of Tyson's Corner, VA at the Association
          for Manufacturing Technology as an Industry Analyst. While in this current position, I have greatly improved
          my skills in the Microsoft suite of products (Excel, Access, Word, PowerPoint, Power BI) and have recently
          begun to really formalize in my mind that I want to become a data scientist. <br><br>
          In my mind, there are two ways I can accomplish this:<br>
          <span>
            1. Obtain a Master's degree in Data Science<br>
            2. Take advantage of the plethora of online courses and develop a curriculum to obtain the skills needed
            as a data scientist
          </span><br><br>
          <em>I have decided to go the route of online classes, and below is my rationale for this decision
          and the curriculum I have developed for this journey</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Rationale for the Online Data Science Master's</h3>
          <p> <a name="Rationale for the Online Data Science Master's"> </a>
              The number of online resources teaching data science has exploded
              in recent years. I can learn the content I need via these online programs faster and
              for a fraction of the cost.
              The next main reason for choosing the online route is the cost aspect.
              Having exhausted my parent's financial resources (THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH!)
              on my undergraduate education, the financial burden of higher education would
              fall direcly on my shoulders. In order to afford this, I would have to take out
              up to $50K in financial loans that I am not interested in dealing with. Given
              the high quality of the online resources out there, this seems irresponsible.
